Design and coding by Ruud Helderman, January-April 2015.

Spaceship created with Blender (http://www.blender.org). All other graphics created with GIMP (http://www.gimp.org).
All sound effects created with SoX (http://sox.sourceforge.net).
Code based on Ruud's award-winning i-mode game 'Space Tunnel' (http://www.dojadragon.com/?doc=st).
Gameplay inspired by 'Master of the Lamps' and 'Aliens: The Computer Game', two games published by Activision in the mid 1980s, both of which featured a similar 'ride through the hoops'.
